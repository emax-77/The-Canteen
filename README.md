#  Django web app for ordering food in the canteen.

***Unfortunately, I can't implement the payment method because I'm a private person, so I can't get the API key for the payment method (it's only for businesses). The same goes for the delivery method :( However, the rest of the project works fine :)***

## Includes login/registration, ordering system, and order management with email notifications, contact form, and some form of payment and delivery

### What already works:
- Auth app (login/registration) 
- Food ordering
- Email confirmation
- Contact form

#### What's next:
 - menu for the whole week (not only for today)
 - order numbers
